# Pop The Dots

This is small game I was working on the try and start getting familiar with [Lua](https://www.lua.org). This game is made with [Löve2D](https://love2d.org). I had used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/wttKHL90Ank?si=Ie5ZAFG_ViDng9ye) on [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) from [Challacade](https://www.youtube.com/@Challacade) to help me set up and use [Löve2D](https://love2d.org). 

I have ignored many of [Löve2D's](https://love2d.org) main functions, modules and other features in the first attempt at making a game in [Lua](https://www.lua.org) to give myself a chance to try and use more vanilla [Lua](https://www.lua.org) to get a better grasp of it.

## Setup and running the game

### Requirements

- Lua (Either by installing the VS Code Extension for [Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) or installing it locally)
- [Löve2D's](https://love2d.org) 
- VS Code is recommended as it will have extension to make running the game far simpler.
- The extension is [Love2D Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d) in VS Code extensions 
- You can refer back to [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/wttKHL90Ank?si=Ie5ZAFG_ViDng9ye) as well to help guide your setup

You can pull the repo and once you are in the `main.lua` file, you can run the game using the [Love2D Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d) extension
